# FINAL
This is a Church Management System created with nodejs and reactjs with mondodb database.

To all members of Panthera Technologies,
You'll all need to install mongodb on your machines to be able to test the application.

After cloning the application, open command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
In the directory, move into the frontend directory (cd frontend).
Then type "yarn add all" to install all dependencies for the react application.

Now for the node server, move one directory back (cd ..) and enter the server directory(CD server).
Then type "npm install" to install all dependencies for the node server.

After installing all dependencies and in the same directory, run the server by typing " nodemon start" or "npm start".
If successful you'll see a message saying SERVER is running, and mongodb is connected.

Open another command prompt window and navigate to the frontend directory.
Now start the react application by typing "yarn start".
If successful, it will open the login page in your default browser, or copy the URL(localhost:3000) and paste into any browser.

To login, create a user account, by going to the register page.
NOTE: There are three roles so the role you choose will determine which page you'll be allowed to view. I advise you create users for all roles
so that you'll be able to view all pages.

After registration, login and test all features.

Also, under the admin page, the generate report feature will be available in version 2.01
